# Everything i did the whole in TCG

This I week did arrays on Javascript.Arrays are to store multiple value in a single variable , 
instead of declearing separate variables for each value.I also larned about the Java loop ,if you know you how
many times you want to loop through a black of code ,use the for loop instead of a while loop.My typing speed is 
getting much better since I have been racing with my fellow students.
