#My week

After Months of being locked down ,I got to Do something like I practically enjoy doing.It was tough sitting at home and
not having access to internet to learn more of coding.My week was more of uplifting i was able to pick up from
where I left of.This week I was introduced to javascript and i have be enough it tough then the other ones but
we have to learn from the hard way.I learned about variables and how they oporate ,The presantion we were given on 
the javascript on variables did help me get through some things that i did not understand.And on my typing speed 
I am still learning.
