My days here at TCG are great, i am able to leran so many things ,its a little challenging but 
nothing comes easy i have to work work hard to reach the goal.
TCG helps a lot because we are able to create things that my change someones and change the 
future for the better .Coding is interesting ,fun and challenging .
The coding ground changes many peoples lives.

TCG reqires hard work ,passion and dertimination and a empty mindset ,because a teacher once said and 
i qoute if you want to know something you have to clear your
mind and learn don't get in the room and act like you know because you wont grab a thing.
So TCG is fun and i enjoy waking up in the morning and coming to TCG.
