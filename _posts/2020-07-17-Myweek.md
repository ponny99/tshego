#what i learnt from coding during the weel

starting with the calculator was a hectic and fun expirence .At my First calculator wouldnt work because i couldnt link my javascript with html
but i was able to make it work .I used the  function , document and try and my calculator was able to work.

#My daily activities at tcg

My typying speed is getting much better and i was behind with the freecode camp but after fixing my calculator i had to the freecode 
camp to catch.And i got introduced to the if and else statements .When a condition for an if statement is true, the block of code following 
it is executed. And when that condition is false. With an else statement, an alternate block of code 
can be executed.
