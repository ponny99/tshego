 # Progress of the week .Debugging: Use the JavaScript Console to Check the Value of a Variable

 I learnt that "both Chrome and Firefox have excellent JavaScript consoles, also known as DevTools,
 for debugging your JavaScript".The console.log() method, which "prints" the output of what's within 
 its parentheses to the console, will likely be the most helpful debugging tool. I also learnt that placing it at strategic 
 points in your code can show you the intermediate values of variables. It's good practice to have an idea 
 of what outcomes will be like before looking at it .Having check points to see the status of your 
 calculations throughout your code will help narrow down where the problem is.

 I am still working on my typing speed and I think its improving .
