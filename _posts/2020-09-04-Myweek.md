# How and what I Leant during the week

A recursive function always has a condition to stop calling itself, otherwise, 
it will call itself indefinitely. Generally, recursive functions are used to break down a big problem 
into smaller ones. You can find that they are heavused in the data structures like binary trees and 
graphs and algorithms such as binary search and quicksort.

I did the function return, it is when javaScript reaches a return statement , the function will stop executing. 
If the function was invoked from a statement , Javascript will "return" to execute the code after the invoking 
statement .Function often compute a return value .The return value is "returned" back to the "caller".

I also looked at the return early pattern function ,the return early parttern in javascript is a simple way
to reduce the number of else statement within a function body to zero . there are many reasons to prefer this 
pattern over using else statements.
*Reducing the total amount of code on the page. 
*Reducing line length by reducing logical complexity. 
*Improve reodability.
