# README

README (as the name suggests: "read me") is the first file one should read when starting a new project. 
It's a set of useful information about a project, and a kind of manual. A README text file appears in many 
various places and refers not only to programming. We will focus on a programmer's README, though.


# Added README file on GitHub appears under the list of files in a repository. 

If we work professionally or learn coding, many times we come across the public repositories. We use the 
libraries made available by other developers as an open source code or we make our contribution to a project, 
reporting/fixing bugs, and adding new functionalities. Certainly, we use these projects because they just come 
in handy, and offer a high quality solution.


# What's the use of writing a good README?

I think you can guess it already. A good README is for others to understand what our code includes, and why 
it's noteworthy. A README file is also essential to retreive a project - on GitHub but also in browsers

OK, now let's check why we should care for our README files since the first project!
Even if the code is just for you, possibly you will come back to it after a while. A good README enables you 
to relaunch a project - without wasting your time on recalling: What was it all about?For a budding programmer,
GitHub is a calling card. The projects on GitHub are most often our portfolio. When we're at a career stage 
without a considerable commercial experience or nice-looking non-profit projects, a presentation of our achievements 
in a form of repositories is one of the best way to get visible to the recruiters. A preparation of several 
demonstration projects we want to show off during the interview works the best. If we are just learning and we 
drop our training projects there, let's pay attention to their good description. Even a non-technical recruiter
will be able to recognize the technologies we touched, and check if it goes in line with a candidate's profile 
he's/she's looking for.
