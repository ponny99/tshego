# The difference between GIT and GITHUB 

We were given a task to go look for the difference between GIT and GITUB.I have done my homework and the research 
states that the difference between GIT and GITHUB it is that "GIT is a distribute version control tool that can manage 
a developer project source code history , while GITHUB is a cloud based platform built around the GIT tool .GIT is a developer 
installs locally on their computer ,while GITHUB is online service that stores code pushed to it from computer runnning the 
GIT tool."

## The key difference between GIT and GITHUB 

"They key diffence between GIT and GITHUB is that is an open source tool developers install locally to manage 
source code, while GITHUB is an online service to which develops who use GIT can connect and upload or download 
resources."

## what have i learned about GIT and GITHUB 

I learned that GIT is intalled locally and GITHUB is hosted in a cloud.and that GITHUB was created for safety
purposes to store all your work incase your computer get lost or crashes.
