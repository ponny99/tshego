## What I learnt this week 

The whole I was busy with freeCodeCamp and it is getting harder everyday. I also learnt that there are some things
that Javascript does complain about .Writing a program that is not syntancitially valid will immediately treigger
an error. 

My typing speed is getting better everyday.
