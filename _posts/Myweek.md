# What i learned the week at TCG

## Monday ,Tuesday, 
On this day we were introduced and taught on how to to open a a folder and a file .And we were also taught how add 
and push them to the GITHUB .I got to practice until i could say that i  got it and i can do it by myself .And 
on the freecode camp I was busy with the CSS-GRID and i came some challenges and confusions i noted them down 
so i could i can get answers so that i could be able to move forward.

## Wednesday, thursday and friday 
I was busy with the CSS-GRID i managed to complite  it and i went to the next challenge ,which i was tested to 
creat a  tribute page and i creating of for Amandla Stenburg an American influancial teenage actress and singer.
I managed to complete it too and now I am busy learning how to do a food survey .Some of this tests are hard but
somehow we all manage to pull though.

I am hoping for much to do here at TCG and i hope it will all bring the best out of me .
