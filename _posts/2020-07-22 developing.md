# What I have learnt this week at TCG.

## About the assignment.
We were given an assignment to creat an online shop ,since the pandemic has restriction and movements are 
restricted and people are not allowed to move around which might endanger their lives.The assignment was hard 
at first but it became easy and I used my knowlegde to fixed some problems.Creating things on the PC is so much 
fun and heard at the same time.My week was perfectly fine and I learned alot on Javascript about variables and
function , and how they operate .It was helpful and being intriduced to Javascript.
